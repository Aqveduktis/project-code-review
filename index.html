          <h1>Why Code Review?</h1>
          <p>
            Code review is a form of peer review where code is being reviewed to improve it. The review is being performed by people other than the author.
            The primary goal of the review is to discover and fix problems or flaws.  However there are other objectives with the review as well. 
            Objectives like improving the quality of the code, sharing knowledge and increase a sense of solidarity between coders.
