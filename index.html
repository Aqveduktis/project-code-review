    Code review is a form of peer review where code is being reviewed to improve it. The review is being performed by people other than the author.
    The primary goal of the review is to discover and fix problems or flaws.  However there are other objectives with the review as well. 
    Objectives like improving the quality of the code, sharing knowledge and increase a sense of solidarity between coders. 
    Sometimes code reviews are mandatory for example when the software will be used in public transportation. 
    Even when code review is not mandatory it will alwas be helpful to have someone else look over your work.
