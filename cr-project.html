    <p><h1> Why code review?</h1></p>
    <!-- The paragraf could probably be solved better but it is what it is -->
    <h2>Code Review</h2>
    <p>Code review is a form of peer review where code is being reviewed to improve it. The review is being performed by people other than the author.</p> 
    <p>The primary goal of the review is to discover and fix problems or flaws.  However there are other objectives with the review as well. </p>
    <p>Objectives like improving the quality of the code, sharing knowledge and increase a sense of solidarity between coders. </p>
    <p>Sometimes code reviews are mandatory for example when the software will be used in public transportation. </p>
    <p>Even when code review is not mandatory it will alwas be helpful to have someone else look over your work. </p>
